    <h1 class="ep"> Eating Plans </h1>
    <p class="ep">  For example If a woman began eating optimally at age 20, she could increase her lifespan by just over 10 years, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine. A man eating the healthier diet from age 20 could add 13 years to his life. Focusing on a healthier diet could also lengthen the lives of older adults, the study said.</p>
   
    
    <p class=ep> To sum everything up and the point im trying to make is that having a good healthy eating plan can change your life and increase your lifespan for the greater good. This means you can be healthy and not have to worry about health issues,Without balanced nutrition, your body is more prone to disease, infection, fatigue, and low performance. Children who donâ€™t get enough healthy foods may face growth and developmental problems, poor academic performance, and frequent infections, they can also develop unhealthy eating habits that may persist into adulthood.</p>
